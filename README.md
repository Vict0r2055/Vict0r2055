## 🔭 Current Projects

### 🧠 MSc Research: Morpheme-Aware Tokenization & isiZulu LLM

Building a morpheme-aware tokenization pipeline and adapting Large Language Models for isiZulu, a low-resource, morphologically rich Nguni language.

- Curating a balanced isiZulu corpus from literature, media, government and educational sources  
- Text preprocessing: normalization, deduplication, filtering and cleaning  
- Designing a morphology-aware pipeline using **canonical segmentations**, noun class prefixes, verb extensions and agglutinative structure  
- Integrating **morpheme-aware BPE / constrained subword tokenization** to respect morpheme boundaries  
- Training / adapting LLaMA-style models for isiZulu using custom tokenizers  
- Evaluating tokenization and language modelling using:
  - Perplexity, BLEU, token coverage  
  - Fertility (ϕ), Morphological Edit Distance (μₑ), Morphological Consistency F1 (μc)  
- Long-term goal: improve digital support for isiZulu in education, communication, and real-world applications

### 🔧 Zulu NLP Tooling & Tokenizer Experiments

Developing a small ecosystem of tools around isiZulu NLP:

- A **ZuluMorph-style morphological analyzer** and morpheme segmenter  
- Tokenizer experiments with **hybrid morpheme + BPE** approaches  
- Scripts for computing custom tokenization metrics and evaluation tables  
- Prototyping REST-style or CLI tooling for:
  - Text ingestion (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, JSON)  
  - Morphological segmentation and tagging  
  - Exporting annotated text for downstream modelling

### 📦 Asset Manager (Side Project)

A lightweight asset management system for lab / campus equipment:

- Backend with **FastAPI** (or similar Python stack)  
- JWT-based authentication & role-based access (admin / staff)  
- Asset categories, vendors, assignment and issue tracking  
- Simple, clean React-based UI for staff to manage and view assets

### 🎓 Campus Buddy (Student Productivity)

A mobile-oriented solution to support student life:

- Class scheduling and timetable management  
- Exam seating plans  
- Campus maps and navigation  
- Integration of a basic **chatbot** to assist with academic queries

### 🍷 Wine Pairing Recommendation System

Responsive web app built for a university consumer department:

- Helps waiters select appropriate wine pairings for meals  
- Optimized for **tablets and small devices** used in service environments  
- Focused on usability, responsive layout and clear interaction flows

## 📚 Past Research Highlight

### 🔍 Real-Time Fraud Detection with Machine Learning (Honours Research)

Analysed the efficiency of multiple ML algorithms for real-time fraud detection on transactional data.

- Evaluated KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost  
- Simulated streaming / queued transaction flows and measured:
  - Detection performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
  - **Latency** from transaction arrival to fraud decision  
  - Overhead of ML models at different transaction rates  
- Focused on the trade-off between **model complexity**, **accuracy**, and **response time** in financial systems
